                    When the question is how we can make a website we must know how it works? The answer is simple. We all know that internet has connected ourselves. If we think we can find how. Just like if you visit a website thore have a big database or any interaction with you there is a backend process. When clients wants to know anything which belongs to their database they take that argument as a get_request(). Client give a request server listens to it and then send the answer to the client. That is a more complicated process that we won't cover here. As you follow along with our youtube channel and read our blogs you will understand and also able to make your dream project. Back to our topic that If you want to make a website you need to know markup laguage and few programming languages and frameworks, We wil get back later about frameworks.So when you visits a website you will find that there are three things are togather working. Which are they? First the content that is what we read, see, listen etc This is created by a markup laguage. They lets you create contents After that if you notice we find styling. How a content is showing themeselves infornt of us. How a video is playing how a image is working. All are the content of styling. Last thing is logic or behaviour. How a website will work and how will contents will show of. Thats the main fundamental of creating a website.
